AWS Academy Cloud Architecting 2.x - Capstone Project :

Click on the start lab.

wait till the the light near AWS to become green.

click on AWS.


Steps Used to Create project:

1. Create a database in RDS
DB Name : example
User Name : admin
Password : lab-password
VPC- Example VPC
security group - Example-DB

*** Don't wait for the database become available instead of do the next steps.

2. Check security group : ALBSG, Bastion-SG, Example-DB and Inventory-App 

3. Create new keypair : vockey2 (ssh passthrough)
	Go to key pairs
		Name - vockey2

4. Download the PPK file 
	* Go to Capstone project page on AWS academy.
	* On upper right side go to AWS details 
	*  Click on "Download PPK"

5. Create EC2-Instance Web Application. 
	
	* AMI - Amazon Linux 2 AMI
	* Instance type- t2.Small
	* VPC - Example VPC
	* Subnet - Private Subnet 1
	* Auto- assigne Public IP - Disable
	* IAM role - Inventory-App-Role
	* Name - ExampleApp
	* CLick on "Select an existing securitygroup - after that select the "Inventory App" security group.
	* Select an Existing Key - vockey2

	IMP STEP - After creating the Instance go to Security Group - Inventory App and in the inbound rule 
		* add the type - SSH 
			* 	on the search box near the source - type -> "bastion-SG" - and select it 
		* Click on Save rules.   


6. Create Parameter Store in System Manager
/example/endpoint - example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
/example/username - admin
/example/password - lab-password
/example/database - example

7. Access the ExampleApp via bastion instance.
	* Open the pagent (go to search box in your PC - search pagent - put the vockey2 key in the pagent - close the pagent )
	* Open the putty 
	* Click on connection , on the right side "Seconds between keepalives" - 30 
	* Click on session , after that on the HOst name ENTER THE IPv4 ADDRESS of "Bastion" Instance. 
	* Go to CONNECTION-SHH-AUTH - click on ALLOW AGENT FORWARDING. then click on "browse" and select the location of the PPK file you downloaded earlier.
	* on the  pop-up click on Accept.
	* login as - ec2-user 
	(after the above command you will see like this-> ec2-use@ip-<private IPv4 address of Bastion instance>)
	* On the command line type: ssh ec2-user@<private IPv4 address of ExampleApp instance you created earlier>
	* after that type- yes
	(after the above command you will now login as ExampleApp and on the command line you will see like this-> ec2-use@ip-<private IPv4 address of ExampleApp instance>)

8. Install the  Apache Web Server (httpd) and Mysql on Instance ExampleApp, on the command line : 
	ping www.google.com 
	click ctrl + c 
	sudo su
	yum install -y httpd mysql
	amazon-linux-extras install -y php7.2

9. Download SQL , on the command line : 
	wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ILT-TF-200-ACACAD-20-EN/capstone-project/Countrydatadump.sql

10. Download source code Web App, on the command line : 
	wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ILT-TF-200-ACACAD-20-EN/capstone-project/Example.zip

11. extract source Web App and copy in directory /var/www/html, on the command line: 
	unzip Example.zip -d /var/www/html/
	ls /var/www/html/Example/

12. enable and start service httpd, on the command line: 
	systemctl enable httpd
	systemctl start httpd
	systemctl status httpd


13. login to your database by using the following command line :
	mysql -u admin -p --host example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
	Enter the password - lab-password
	show databases;
	exit;

14. import data ke database :
	mysql -u admin -p --host example.cbufnmin3yj3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com example  < Countrydatadump.sql
	Enter the password - lab-password
	exit
	exit

15. Create Target Group
	VPC- Example VPC
	advanced health check setting-
		Healthy threshold - 2
		Interval - 10
	
	tags-
		Add tag-
			Name - TG-Example
	click on creat target group

16. Create Load Balancer
	Select Application Load balancer
	Name - LB-Example
	VPC- Example VPC
		select first region - us-east-1a
			select subnet - public subnet 1
		select second region - us-east-1b
			select subnet - public subnet 2
	security groups 
		select - ALBSG 
	liseners and rounting-
		select - TG-Example
	click on create load balancer

17. Create Auto Scalling Group
	Name- ASG-Example
	on lunch template - 
		select - Example-LT
	Network -
		VPC - Example VPC
		subnets-
			Select private subnet 1
			Select private subnet 2
	load balancing -
		click on attach an exsting load balancer.
		select - TG-Example
18. Go to your Instances tab there are 2 more instances are launcing wait for 2 to 3 min. to pass the checks.

19. Test the Web Application by using load balancer DNS in new tab.
	Go to Load balancer you created earlier.
	copy the DNS address of the load balancer and paste it in a new tab.
